## Content Management Guide

All content is managed through JSON files in the `/data/` directory. This makes it easy to update information without touching code.

  "heroImage": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID"
}
```

## Image Management

### 🖼️ Using External Images

All images are hosted externally (Google Drive, CDN, etc.) and referenced by URL. No local image files needed.

**Google Drive Image Setup:**
1. Upload image to Google Drive
2. Right-click → Share → "Anyone with the link"
3. Copy the share link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`
4. Convert to direct link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`
5. Use the converted URL in your JSON files

**Image Requirements:**
- **Speaker/Organizer photos**: Square aspect ratio, min 400x400px
- **Hero/Venue images**: Wide aspect ratio (16:9), min 1200x675px  
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, WebP
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web (tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim)

### 🎨 Image Best Practices

- Use high-quality images with good lighting
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios within categories
- Compress images to reduce load times
- Use descriptive filenames when uploading
- Test image URLs before adding to JSON

## Deployment

### 🚀 GitHub Pages (Current Setup)

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch:

**Live URL**: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME/`

**Deployment Process**:
1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions runs the build process
3. Site deploys automatically (2-5 minutes)
4. Check deployment status in GitHub Actions tab

**Configuration**:
- Uses conditional `basePath` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Development: runs on `localhost:3000` 
- Production: includes proper path prefixes

### 🔄 Making Updates

1. **Edit JSON files** in `/data/` directory
2. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`
3. **Commit and push** to main branch
4. **Wait for deployment** (check GitHub Actions)
5. **Verify changes** on live site

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **404 on deployed site**: Check that all internal links use Next.js `Link` component
- **Images not loading**: Verify external image URLs are publicly accessible
- **Build failures**: Check for syntax errors in JSON files
- **Local development issues**: Ensure `npm install` completed successfully

**Getting Help**:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for deployment errors
- Validate JSON syntax with an online JSON validator
- Test image URLs directly in browser
- Review the `/CLAUDE.md` file for development guidelines

## Architecture Notes

This website uses:
- **Next.js 14** with App Router and TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom components
- **JSON-based content** for easy non-technical updates
- **External images** to avoid repository bloat
- **GitHub Pages** deployment with automated workflows
- **SEO optimization** with structured data and metadata

The design prioritizes maintainability and ease of updates for conference organizers without technical backgrounds.
